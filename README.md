# TP1 - AEDS3
## Introduction
Project developed during the discipline "Algoritmos e Estruturas de Dados III", in DCC/UFMG.

The goal of this project was to write a C program to solve the maximum flow problem on a flow network (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_flow_problem).

The problem was solved using an implementation of the Edmondsâ€“Karp algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonds%E2%80%93Karp_algorithm). 

## Build

The project can be built on any linux machine using the Makefile available.
